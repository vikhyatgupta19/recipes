        <p> Paneer Bhurji is a popular and delicious North Indian breakfast recipe made from crumbled paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese).</p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Paneer </li>
            <li> Tomatoes </li>
            <li> Onions </li>
            <li> Ginger Garlic Paste </li>
            <li> Spices (Red Chilli Powder, Turmeric Powder, Garam Masala Powder) </li>
            <li> Cumin </li>
            <li> Green Chillies </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Crumble 200 to 250 grams paneer (cottage cheese) with your fingers and keep aside.</li>
            <li> Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a frying pan or kadai. You can even use ghee or butter instead of oil. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and let them crackle.</li>
            <li> Then add ½ cup finely chopped onions. </li>
            <li> Sauté the onions till they turn translucent and soften. Sauté onions on a medium-low heat.</li>
            <li> Then add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chillies. </li>
            <li> Mix very well and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away. </li>
            <li> Add 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes. </li>
            <li> Mix the tomatoes and begin to sauté them on a medium-low flame. </li>
            <li> Sauté the tomatoes till they completely soften. You can also add a pinch of salt so that the tomatoes get cooked faster. You will see oil releasing from the sides from the mixture once the tomatoes are softened. </li>
            <li> Now add all the spice powders – ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder (or ¼ to ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper), ½ teaspoon coriander powder and ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala. </li>
            <li> Mix very well and sauté for 5 to 6 seconds.</li>
            <li> Add the crumbled paneer and salt as per taste.</li>
            <li> Mix thoroughly and cook the paneer for 1 minute. Don’t cook the paneer for a long time as they harden and loose their softness.</li>
            <li> Switch off the flame and lastly add 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well and serve</li>
        </ol>
